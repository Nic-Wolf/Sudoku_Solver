 - DOM!

 	take the data from the html element of coice (TBA) and store them in an object for evaluation

 - DATA STRUCTURES?

 	- we need a data structure that allows for SIMPLE AND EASY evaluation between rows and columns
 	- needs to be organized and portable
 	- needs to be able to evaluate matrixes (rows and columns)
 	- needs to be able to evaluate the respective matrixes, and their rows and columns

 	possible structure:

 		[{}]



 		matrix 1:
 			rows


 - ALGORITHM?

 	each matrix has 9 numbers, in 3 rows of 3

 	so, every 123, has to evaluate the congruent 123's
 	ditto for 
 		across:
 		123
 		456
 		789
 		down:
 		147
 		258
 		369

 	each matrix much check other matrixes.

 	123    matrix checks at verticle (matrix array -3, -6, +3 and +6)
 	456	   maxtrix checks at sides (matrix array -1, -2, +1 and +2)
 	789    set them explicitly from their array entries!



 - NECESSARY I/O?


 problem 1 : needs to take in a partial sudoku matrix and build the board..

 // every row and column needs to === 45

// every row and column must contain values 1 - 9

// every matrix must contain values 1 - 9



get matrix 1 @ 123, matrix 2 @ 123, matrix 3 at 123

get matrix @ index 456


matrix 1 interacts with matrix 2, 3, 4, 7
matrix 2 interacts with matrix 1, 3, 5, 8
matrix 3 interacts with matrix 1, 2, 6, 9
matrix 4 interacts with matrix 1, 5, 6, 7
matrix 5 interacts with matrix 2, 4, 6 ,8
matrix 6 interacts with matrix 3, 4, 5, 9
matrix 7 interacts with matrix 1, 4, 8, 9
matrix 8 interacts with matrix 2, 5, 7, 9
matrix 9 interacts with matrix 3, 6, 7, 8
